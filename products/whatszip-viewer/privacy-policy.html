      Last Updated: June 28, 2025
    </p>

    <p class="lead pt-4">
      This Privacy Policy describes how WhatsZip Viewer ("the App") collects,uses, and discloses your information in
      connection with your use of the App.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h2 pt-4">
      1. Introduction
    </h2>

    <p class="lead">
      WhatsZip Viewer is designed to help you view and interact with WhatsApp chat exports (zip files) directly on your
      device. Our primary goal is to provide a secure and private viewing experience.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h2 pt-4">
      2. Information We DO NOT Collect
    </h2>

    <p class="lead fw-bold">

      WhatsZip Viewer is designed with your privacy in mind. We want to be absolutely clear: The App itself DOES NOT
      collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data from your device.

    <p class="lead">This means:</p>
    <ul class="lead">

      <li>
        We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, or any other personally identifiable information.
      </li>

      <li>


        We do not collect information about your device, location, or usage patterns.
      </li>

      <li>

        We do not access or collect any data from the WhatsApp chat export files (including messages, images, videos, or
        audio) that you choose to load into the App. All processing of these files occurs <span class="fw-bold">locally
          on your device only.</span>
      </li>

      <li>


        We do not send any crash logs, analytics data, or usage statistics to our servers or third-party services.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2 class="h2 pt-4">
      3. How We Handle Your Data (Locally on Your Device)
    </h2>

    <p class="lead">

      When you use WhatsZip Viewer, you interact with files (WhatsApp chat export zip files and their contents) that
      reside on your own device.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
      <span class="fw-bold">Local Processing:</span> The App functions entirely offline after installation. All parsing,
      displaying, and media playback
      of your chat data happens locally within the App on your device.

    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      <span class="fw-bold">Temporary Files:</span> To facilitate viewing of media (images, videos, audio) within the
      App, temporary files may be
      created on your device. These temporary files are designed to be deleted automatically when the App is closed or
      when the associated media is no longer needed. We do not retain these temporary files beyond the immediate viewing
      session, and they are never transmitted off your device.

    </p>
    <p class="lead">
      <span class="fw-bold">No Cloud Storage Integration:</span> WhatsZip Viewer does not integrate with any cloud
      storage services (e.g., Google
      Drive, iCloud, Dropbox) for uploading or storing your chat data. You are solely responsible for managing the
      storage
      and backup of your WhatsApp chat export files on your device.

    </p>

    <h2 class="h2 pt-4">


      4. Permissions Required by the App
    </h2>

    <p class="lead">

      WhatsZip Viewer requests the following permissions to function:

    </p>
    <p class="lead">

      <span class="fw-bold pt-2">Storage Access:</span> This permission is
      required to allow you to select
      and load WhatsApp chat export zip files from your device's storage, and to create temporary files for media
      playback. Without this permission, the App cannot open the chat export files.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h2 pt-4">

      5. Third-Party Services
    </h2>

    <p class="lead">

      WhatsZip Viewer does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services.

    </p>

    <h2 class="h2 pt-4">


      6. Children's Privacy
    </h2>

    <p class="lead">


      WhatsZip Viewer is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal
      information from children under 13. If you believe we may have collected information from a child under 13, please
      contact us.
    </p>

    <h2 class="h2 pt-4">

      7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
